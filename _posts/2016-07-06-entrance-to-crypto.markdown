Being a believer of fate, I stumbled upon an opportunity to dive into
the community of cryptocurrency.  I have never read or researched into
cryptocurrency, so this experience
is completely new.

In this case, I went the other way.  I first looked into alternate coins,
cryptocurrencies that are based on, say, Bitcoin.  This one is called
Syscoin.  Then I start to read into the communities and further
investigate into bitcoin.

{% highlight shell %}
git clone https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin2
cd syscoin/syscoin2
./autogen.sh
./configure.sh
make
{% endhighlight %}

According to the github guide, this is supposed to work... but it
didn't.  Well, not on my Mac.
Since the beginning wasn't smooth.  I thought it might not be smooth for
other people too.  So I decided that I should blog all the steps I took
to dive into the cryptocurrency world.

Somethings I learned right away...:
Satoshi Nakamoto is a mystery
Bitcoin is different from bitcoin.  First is the technology, latter is
the currency
When Google searching, make sure the date filter is on.  2 years old
news is considered ancient.
