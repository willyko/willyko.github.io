Here I shall describe what first day of bitcoin should've been like had
I not slack around that much

1.  Register for [coinbase.com][coinbase-url] account (so that at least you have a
bitcoin wallet address to play with)
I know...I know...I should use a local wallet.  But wait, I'm
recording what I did right?
ps. embedded referral

3.  Register for bitcoin exchange.  I went with
    [Poloniex][poloniex-url].  There's also [btc38][btc38-url] 
which allows easy facebook login 

4.  Now, the community.  [bitcointalk][bitcointalk-url].  Be sure to
search and read the newbie guide.  Took me awhile to realize that if
you post images as a newbie the image won't show.   If you read Chinese,
I think [8btc][8btc-url] is probably the place to be too. Surf away!
Digging articles traversing back in time is a time consuming task.

2.  Try some faucets...get the feel of how satoshis are handed out
Keep in mind I've only been playing around bitcoin for maybe a week
or two? The consensus is that faucets are generally not worth the
time... but instead of sitting around I don't mind clicking on random
CAPTCHA.  (Note: all links below are embedded with my referral...I mean
why not?)

    [YourBit][yourbit-url]
This one is my favourite.  Since I started, this one racked up the most.
At the rate of 1 click per hour.  Not too long, not too short.

    [BonusBitcoin][bonusbitcoin-url]
Second favourite.  The CAPTCHA experience feels smoother for some reason...  This one is 1 click per 30 minutes

    [ClaimBTC][claimbtc-url]
    [TakeFreeBTC][takefreebtc-url]
These two have near identical interfaces.  Difference being one is one
click per 20 minutes and the latter one is one click per 5 minutes.
Honestly, 5 minutes is too frequent to my liking...Doesn't give you
enough time to focus back on whatever you were working on

    [Moonbit][moonbit-url]
[LooTool][lootool-url]
[FieldBit][fieldbit-url]
The above three are similar in that they have 5 minutes minimum wait time,
and beyond the gain gets slower and slower.  For best rate, 1 click per
5 minutes.
Fieldbit being last because the rate is slow and the CAPTCHA flow isn't
good... For me, almost every time I click I have to do one more CAPTCHA
to log-in and then one more to submit.

    Regarding all faucets... They all require you to turn off ad-blocker.
Sometimes I can hear my laptop screaming as the ads and videos
overloads as I prefer to have them open in 7 tabs and just leave them
there.  Also, all of them seem sketchy, please don't be too serious with
them. There are way more faucets out there.  These are just what I
selected in the beginning after some brief research
