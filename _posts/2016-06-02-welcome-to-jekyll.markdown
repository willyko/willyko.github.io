This is the creation of Alpacado Software Solution.  This is an umbrella group name for multiple projects that I have in mind.

A quick background on the name "ALPACADO".  It's a cross of Alpaca and Avocado. Period. 

So this site is built on jekyll following exactly as the website stated: 

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight shell %}
jekyll new landing-page
cd landing-page
jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}
